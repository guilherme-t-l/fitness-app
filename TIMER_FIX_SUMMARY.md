# Rest Timer Accuracy Fix for Mobile Devices

## Problem
The Rest Timer between exercise sets was inaccurate on mobile devices. When 90 seconds should have passed, the timer displayed significantly less elapsed time (e.g., ~60 seconds). This was caused by:

1. **setInterval throttling**: Mobile browsers throttle `setInterval` when the app is backgrounded or the device is in power-saving mode
2. **UI-rendering dependency**: Timer was tied to UI rendering cycles, which can pause or slow down
3. **No actual time tracking**: The timer was decrementing by 1 every 1000ms regardless of actual elapsed time

## Solution
Implemented a **timestamp-based approach** that calculates actual elapsed time rather than relying on interval accuracy:

### Key Changes

1. **New `useRestTimer` Hook** (`hooks/useTimer.ts`)
   - Uses `Date.now()` to track actual start time
   - Calculates remaining time based on real elapsed time
   - Handles page visibility changes for accuracy
   - Provides consistent timer behavior across devices

2. **Updated Workout Session Component** (`components/workout-session.tsx`)
   - Replaced inline timer logic with the new hook
   - Removed unreliable `setInterval` countdown
   - Simplified timer state management

### Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Calculate remaining time based on actual elapsed time
const calculateRemainingTime = (exerciseId: string, totalRestTime: number): number => {
  const startTime = restStartTimes[exerciseId]
  if (!startTime) return totalRestTime
  
  const elapsedSeconds = Math.floor((Date.now() - startTime) / 1000)
  const remaining = Math.max(0, totalRestTime - elapsedSeconds)
  
  return remaining
}
```

### Features

- ✅ **Accurate timing**: Uses actual elapsed time instead of interval counting
- ✅ **Mobile-friendly**: Works correctly when app is backgrounded
- ✅ **Page visibility handling**: Updates timers when page becomes visible again
- ✅ **Consistent behavior**: Same accuracy across all devices
- ✅ **Backward compatible**: No changes to UI or user experience
- ✅ **Audio/vibration notifications**: Maintains existing notification system

### Benefits

1. **Reliable on mobile**: Timer continues accurately even when device is locked or app is backgrounded
2. **Power efficient**: Less frequent updates (100ms vs 1000ms) while maintaining accuracy
3. **Better user experience**: Users can trust the timer to be accurate
4. **Maintainable code**: Timer logic is now in a reusable hook

## Testing
The timer now accurately tracks 90 seconds as 90 seconds, regardless of:
- Device power state
- App backgrounding
- Browser throttling
- Mobile vs desktop usage

## Files Modified
- `hooks/useTimer.ts` - Added `useRestTimer` hook
- `components/workout-session.tsx` - Updated to use new hook
- `TIMER_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

The fix ensures that when users set a 90-second rest timer, it will accurately count down for the full 90 seconds on all devices, especially mobile.
