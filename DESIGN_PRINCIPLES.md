# DESIGN PRINCIPLES

## Visual Style
- **Dark Mode by default:** Sleek, modern, and edgy — think high-end nightclub or luxury fitness studio.
- **Inspiration:** Structure and polish from Airbnb, clean typography from Apple, and the dark, rebellious energy of Gymshark Blackout or Nike Training Club's dark mode.
- **Layout:** Clean, spacious, with generous padding and clear visual hierarchy.
- **Micro-interactions:** Smooth, subtle, and refined — never childish or over-the-top.
- **Mood:** Confident, sleek, unapologetically bold. Visual emphasis on strength, exclusivity, and a premium feel.

## Tone
- **Voice:** Confident, sleek, and bold.
- **Animation:** Elegant and modern, never childish or excessive.
- **Brand Feel:** Strong, exclusive, premium.

## Mobile & Responsive Expectations
- **Fully responsive:** Works flawlessly on all devices, from small phones to ultrawide monitors.
- **Mobile-first:** Layouts, touch targets, and readability optimized for handheld devices.
- **No hidden/broken mobile functionality:** No "desktop-only" elements.
- **Navigation & CTAs:** Always obvious and accessible on all screen sizes.

## Accessibility
- **Best practices:** Maintain contrast, logical focus order, and readable text.
- **Dark ≠ hard to read:** Everything must be easy on the eyes and inclusive.

## Performance
- **Smooth interactions:** Quick load times, optimized assets, and fluid UI.

## Design Priorities
- **Visual hierarchy:** Information is scannable at a glance.
- **Breathing room:** Space is strength — don't crowd, but don't leave too much empty space. (Airbnb/Apple inspired)
- **Consistency:** Layouts, button styles, spacing, and interactions are cohesive throughout.
- **Scalability:** Components and layout are easy to expand as new features are added.
