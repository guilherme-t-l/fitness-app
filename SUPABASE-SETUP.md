# 🗄️ Supabase Database Integration Setup

This guide will help you set up Supabase for your fitness app to persist workout data.

## 🚀 Quick Setup Steps

### 1. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Sign up/Login and create a new project
3. Wait for the project to be ready (usually 1-2 minutes)

### 2. Get Your Credentials

1. Go to **Settings** → **API** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy your **Project URL** and **anon/public key**
3. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### 3. Set Up Database Schema

1. Go to **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase-schema.sql`
3. Click **Run** to create the tables and sample data

### 4. Test the Integration

1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Visit your app at `http://localhost:3000`
3. Your workouts should now be loaded from the database!

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables Created:

**`workouts`** - Main workout information
- `id` - Unique identifier (UUID)
- `name` - Workout name
- `description` - Workout description
- `estimated_duration` - Expected duration
- `difficulty` - Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced
- `category` - Workout category
- `created_at` - Creation timestamp
- `last_completed` - Last completion date
- `completions` - Number of times completed
- `user_id` - For future multi-user support

**`exercises`** - Individual exercises in workouts
- `id` - Unique identifier (UUID)
- `workout_id` - Reference to workout
- `name` - Exercise name
- `sets` - Number of sets
- `reps` - Repetitions
- `weight` - Weight used
- `rest_time` - Rest time between sets
- `notes` - Additional notes
- `adjustment` - Machine position/adjustment
- `description` - Exercise description
- `order_index` - Exercise order in workout

**`workout_history`** - Detailed completion tracking
- `id` - Unique identifier (UUID)
- `workout_id` - Reference to workout
- `completed_at` - Completion timestamp
- `duration` - Workout duration
- `notes` - Additional notes
- `user_id` - For future multi-user support

**`exercise_performance`** - Exercise-specific performance data

- `exercise_id` - Reference to exercise
- `workout_id` - Reference to workout
- `completed_at` - Completion timestamp
- `duration` - Exercise duration
- `reps` - Repetitions
- `weight` - Weight used
- `rest_time` - Rest time between sets
- `notes` - Additional notes
- `user_id` - For future multi-user support

## 🔧 Features Implemented

✅ **Data Persistence** - All workouts and exercises saved to database  
✅ **Real-time Updates** - Changes immediately reflected in database  
✅ **CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, Delete workouts  
✅ **Exercise Management** - Full exercise CRUD with ordering  
✅ **Completion Tracking** - Workout completion history  
✅ **Error Handling** - Robust error handling and user feedback  
✅ **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript support  
✅ **Future-Ready** - Easy to extend for multi-user support  

## 🎯 What's Different Now

### Before (In-Memory):
- Data lost on page refresh
- No persistence between sessions
- Sample data only

### After (Database):
- Data persists across sessions
- Real database storage
- Full CRUD operations
- Ready for production

## 🔮 Future Multi-User Support

The schema is already prepared for multi-user support:

1. **User Authentication** - Add Supabase Auth
2. **User-Specific Data** - Use the `user_id` field
3. **Row Level Security** - Update RLS policies
4. **User Management** - Add user profiles

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"Failed to load workouts"**
- Check your `.env.local` file
- Verify Supabase credentials
- Ensure schema is created

**"Database connection error"**
- Check internet connection
- Verify Supabase project is active
- Check browser console for details

**"Tables don't exist"**
- Run the SQL schema in Supabase SQL Editor
- Check for any SQL errors

### Getting Help:

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase dashboard shows data
3. Test database connection in Supabase dashboard

## 🎉 Success!

Once setup is complete, your fitness app will have:
- ✅ Persistent workout data
- ✅ Real-time database operations
- ✅ Professional-grade data management
- ✅ Scalable architecture

Your workouts will now be saved and persist across all sessions! 🏋️‍♂️
