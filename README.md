# 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness App — Build. Track. Evolve.

A sleek, no-friction app for planning your workouts, tracking progress, and staying consistent.

Designed for cool and stylish young fitness enthusiasts who appreciate clean UIs as much as clean reps.

## ⚡ Why This Exists

Most workout apps? Bloated. Outdated. Clunky. We built this for people who expect more — in and out of the gym.

**Who it's for:**
- ✅ **Tech-savvy people** who want full control of their training
- ✅ **Minimalists** who love clean, edgy, sexy design

**The vibe:** High-energy, sensual, futuristic. Think:
- 🖤 **Nightclub Aesthetic** — Dark backgrounds, neon accents, moody glow
- 💪 **Gym Performance** — Bold typography, sharp edges, structured layouts  
- 🔥 **Hot People Energy** — Confident, provocative, clean but unapologetic

## ✨ Features That Matter

### 🛠️ **Fully Editable Workouts**
Exercises, order, sets, reps, weights — tweak everything, anytime. Your routine, your rules.

### 🔍 **Smart Progress Tracking**
Visualize your evolution. Spot patterns. Stay accountable.

### 🌙 **Dark, Modern UI**
Your app should look as good as your form. Period.

### ⚡ **Autocomplete Exercise Input**
Type to search. Click to select. No more scrolling through endless dropdowns.

## 🧑‍💻 Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** — UI that just works
- **TypeScript** — Type-safe, predictable code
- **TailwindCSS** — Utility-first, rapid styling
- **Radix UI** — Accessible, unstyled components
