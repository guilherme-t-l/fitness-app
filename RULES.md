## üé® Design Rules

### Visual Style
- **Dark Mode by default:** Sleek, modern, and edgy ‚Äî think high-end nightclub or luxury fitness studio
- **Inspiration:** Structure and polish from Airbnb, clean typography from Apple, and the dark, rebellious energy of Gymshark Blackout or Nike Training Club's dark mode
- **Layout:** Clean, spacious, with generous padding and clear visual hierarchy
- **Micro-interactions:** Smooth, subtle, and refined ‚Äî never childish or over-the-top
- **Mood:** Confident, sleek, unapologetically bold. Visual emphasis on strength, exclusivity, and a premium feel

### Tone & Brand
- **Voice:** Confident, sleek, and bold
- **Animation:** Elegant and modern, never childish or excessive
- **Brand Feel:** Strong, exclusive, premium

### Mobile & Responsive
- **Fully responsive:** Works flawlessly on all devices, from small phones to ultrawide monitors
- **Mobile-first:** Layouts, touch targets, and readability optimized for handheld devices
- **No hidden/broken mobile functionality:** No "desktop-only" elements
- **Navigation & CTAs:** Always obvious and accessible on all screen sizes

### Accessibility
- **Best practices:** Maintain contrast, logical focus order, and readable text
- **Dark ‚â† hard to read:** Everything must be easy on the eyes and inclusive
- **Keyboard navigation:** Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Touch targets:** Minimum 44px for mobile interactions

### Design Priorities
- **Visual hierarchy:** Information is scannable at a glance
- **Breathing room:** Space is strength ‚Äî don't crowd, but don't leave too much empty space (Airbnb/Apple inspired)
- **Consistency:** Layouts, button styles, spacing, and interactions are cohesive throughout
- **Scalability:** Components and layout are easy to expand as new features are added

### Color System
- **Primary:** Green (success, progress)
- **Secondary:** Purple (accent, premium)
- **Neon accents:** Cyan, purple, green for highlights
- **Background:** Dark grays with subtle gradients
- **Text:** High contrast white/gray for readability

## üíª Frontend Development Rules

### Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling:** TailwindCSS with custom design system
- **Components:** shadcn/ui + custom components
- **State Management:** React hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
- **Database:** Supabase with real-time capabilities

### Code Organization
- **File Structure:**
  ```
  app/           # Next.js app router pages
  components/    # Reusable UI components
  hooks/         # Custom React hooks
  lib/           # Utilities and services
  public/        # Static assets
  ```

### Component Standards
- **Custom components must follow design principles**
- **Props interfaces for all components**
- **Error boundaries for async operations**
- **Loading states for all async operations**

### State Management
- **Use custom hooks for complex state**
- **Auto-save all user input**
- **Optimistic updates for better UX**
- **Proper error handling and user feedback**

### Code Quality
- **No any types without explicit justification**
- **Meaningful variable and function names**
- **Comments for most logics**
- **Non-technical person (Product Manager) should be able to understand**

### Performance
- **Lazy loading for non-critical components**
- **Optimized images and assets**
- **Minimal bundle size**
- **Efficient re-renders with proper dependencies**

## üß™ Testing Rules

### AI Tester Agent Framework
- **Perspective:** Product Manager / End User
- **Focus:** Real-world user workflows and scenarios
- **Approach:** User-focused testing, not technical testing

### Test Categories
1. **UI/UX Testing** - Interface usability and user experience
2. **Functionality Testing** - Core feature validation
3. **Workflow Testing** - End-to-end user journeys
4. **Edge Case Testing** - Error handling and boundary conditions

### Test Report Format
Each test report must include:
1. **Test Definition** - What functionality is being tested
2. **Test List** - Specific tests to be executed
3. **Test Execution** - Results of each test
4. **Summary** - Overall verdict and recommendations

### Testing Standards
- **All new features require AI Tester Agent validation**
- **Test on mobile devices first**
- **Verify timer accuracy across devices**
- **Test workout editing workflows end-to-end**
- **Maintain 100% test pass rate**
- **Test accessibility features**

### Success Metrics
- **Total Tests Executed:** Track all tests
- **Success Rate:** Target 100%
- **User Experience Score:** Excellent rating required
- **Mobile Compatibility:** Full functionality on all devices
